Program to insert an element at desired location.

Take the following inputs from a user:-

a) Element: e.g. “PQRS”

b) Desired Location(1-5): e.g. 4

Create a List<Object> with the following values:-
  
{“One”,2,”Three”,67.986,’Z’, “ABC”,123,true, “xyz”}

The ‘Desired Location’ should only be between 1-5. Any other input should give the following error to the user “Only values between 1-5 are allowed, please try again. and the prompt should be redisplayed to the user.

‘Element’ can be any type of the following elements:

a) Boolean - If Boolean reverse the value and then add, i.e. if true you add false to the list.
b) Character - if character, you add the next character to the list i.e. if ‘C’ you add ‘D’….if ‘c’ you add ‘d’ to the list.
c) String - Change the case of string before adding to the list.
d) Float / Double - Add 2.0 before adding to the list.
e) Integer - Add 1 before adding to the list.
Upon successful addition of an element:-
a) Redisplay all the elements of the list on the console.
b) Return the prompt back to the user so he can enter another element.
When the user types ‘#’ on the console, terminate the program.
Use List for implementation.
